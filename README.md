## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- **POST /api/token/**: Generate a token for user authentication.
  - Request body: 
    ```json
    {
      "username": "user_name",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```

- **POST /api/auth/**: Authenticate users using their token. Token must be included in the headers as `Authorization: Token <your-token>`.

### Wallet Management

- **POST /api/wallets/create/**: Create a new wallet for a user. 
  - Request body:
    ```json
    {
      "balance": 1000.0
    }
    ```
  - Authentication is required.

- **GET /api/wallets/status/**: Retrieve the status of all wallets associated with the authenticated user.

### Transactions

- **POST /api/transactions/create/**: Create a new transaction (either "RECHARGE" or "CHARGE").
  - Request body:
    ```json
    {
      "wallet": "wallet-token",
      "transaction_type": "RECHARGE",
      "amount": 50.0
    }
    ```

- **GET /api/transactions/**: Retrieve a list of transactions for a specific wallet or all wallets.
  - Query parameters: 
    - `wallet` (optional): filter transactions by wallet token.

### Error Handling

The API returns appropriate error responses for invalid input, unauthorized access, or other failed actions.

---

### Notes on Transactions

- The transaction types are "RECHARGE" and "CHARGE". For "CHARGE" transactions, two transactions are createdâ€”one for the user's wallet and another for the merchant's wallet.
- The system ensures that charge transactions only proceed if the user has enough balance and if the merchant's wallet exists.
